# The Blog.

This repository contains the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code of a fictitious blog called "The Blog." The site includes a homepage with a header, navigation menu, search bar, and a main content section with an image and a text section. There are also several smaller sections that feature different posts and their respective information.

The code is organized into three main files:

- `index.html`: contains the HTML structure of the site;
- `style.css`: contains the CSS style rules for the site;
- `script.js`: contains the JavaScript code to increase and decrease the font size in the text section.

The site is responsive and includes some interactive features, such as the search bar and the buttons to increase and decrease the font size.

## Accessibility

Accessibility is a priority for The Blog. As such, a functionality to increase or decrease the font size has been included to make the content accessible to all users. The font size control can be found in the "Increase Font Size" section in the featured image of the main content section. By clicking on the "+" and "-" buttons, the font size is changed according to the user's preference.

## How to Run the Site

To run the site, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser. Make sure to maintain the folder structure of the repository so that the files are referenced correctly.

## How to Contribute

Feel free to contribute to the project by reporting issues, suggesting improvements, or adding new features. To do so, simply fork the repository, make the necessary changes, and submit a pull request. We'd be happy to receive your contributions!
